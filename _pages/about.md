I am a final-year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley in the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/), affiliated with [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) and [Berkeley DeepDrive](https://deepdrive.berkeley.edu/), and advised by Prof. [Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/) and Dr. [Wei Zhan](https://zhanwei.site/). 

My research focuses on **behavior simulation for autonomous driving**. Central to this work are machine learning, generative models, reinforcement learning, and robotics. A key aspect is to tackle challenges involving multi-agent, interactive human behavior and complex long-tail scenes at scale.

Currently, Iâ€™m a research intern at [Applied Intuition](https://www.appliedintuition.com/), working on behavior generation, reasoning, and reinforcement learning. Previously, I was a research intern at [NEC Labs](https://www.nec-labs.com/) with [Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/#) and [Francesco Pittaluga](https://www.francescopittaluga.com/), focusing on language-based, safety-critical diffusion models for autonomous driving.

I graduated from National Taiwan University. I worked in [BiroLa](http://biorola.me.ntu.edu.tw/members_alu_ms.html) lab as an undergrad researcher, advised by Prof. [Pei-Chun Lin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KdWMoM4AAAAJ&hl=en), we developed a Spherical Robotics System that with hybrid rolling and leaping capability [[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvrreooQh-I)]. -->
